# Mobify
###About
Mobify is an open source mobile notification software to send messages in real-time to users' mobile devices.

###Status
Work in progress. I intend to have a working version with a online demo by the end of January 2017.

###Modules
* **mobify-server**: RESTful backend using Spring Boot
* **mobify-ui**: User interface for the administrator using AngularJS
* **mobify-mobile**: Mobile application to receive real-time notifications, developed using multi-platform framework Ionic
* **demo-oauth-server**: A OAuth 2.0 authorization server implementation for testing and development purposes. The software should be integrated with your own OAuth 2.0 authentication server for production use.
